# BeerApplication
This is an app that was developed for my mobile applications class in waterford insituite of technology.

The idea is a social media style app where a user can be made and be able to upload a recipe for a craft beer that they have made as well
as a description and images of the beer, users could then browse this list and rate the beer that was added.

#Features currently
A user can be made and is authenticated through firebase useing their email and passw
A user object is stored on a firebase db with their username and profile picture.
A beer can be added with a description, name and an image 
Recylcer view is then used to display all the beers that have then been added so far (currently all the beers are stored in a local json 
file. NOT on firebase) 

#Future features/To-do
All beers will be added to a firebase db.
Username and image will be shown next to the beer that was posted.
Comment section to be added under each beer.
A proper rateing system to be developed to have certain beers with high rateing's rise to the top over others with low rateings.
A proper view for the beer details.
